# QueueMasters
QueueMasters is a project that i started with the purpose of practise my Typescript skills making a backend capable of
handling a queue and socket connections.

# What does QueueMasters do?
QueueMasters is a system thought for multiple synchronized clients being capable of sending Youtube links to be queued, a single 
panel where to see what is the actual queue and the video in progress.

# What can clients do?
Clients can **add new a video** as well as **like the current one**. If the video of a client gets liked the client will be notified.
